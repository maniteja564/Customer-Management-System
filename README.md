# Customer Management System - Java Project
Overview
The Customer Management System is a simple Java-based application designed to help manage a list of customers. It allows users to add, view, and remove customer details such as name, age, and email. This project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures (ArrayList), and user input handling via the console.

# Features

Display Customers: The system lists all stored customers with their details.
Remove Customer: Users can remove a customer from the list by specifying the customer's name.
Interactive Console: The program interacts with users via a console-based interface.
